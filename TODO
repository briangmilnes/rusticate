 We need a configuration which says which rules to run.

 We need uniform logging to analyses and perhaps fixes.
 In a directory for each program, with dates.

 We need uniform timing for these.

32 total binaries, with logging conventions at:
29/32 have timing (Completed in Xms)
22/32 have directory context (Entering directory)
25/32 use comma formatting (format_number)
Missing timing: fix.rs, parse.rs, review.rs (the original stub binaries)
Most of our active tools (count-, review-, fix-, analyze-) are following the conventions. We can circle back to standardize the rest later.
What would you like to work on next?

 Is attic excluded everywhere?
