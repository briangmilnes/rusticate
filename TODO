 We need a configuration which says which rules to run.

I must be AFK so I would like you to execute relentlessly on
the following things:

 We need uniform logging to analyses and perhaps fixes.
 In a directory for each program, with dates.

 We need uniform timing for all programs.

32 total binaries, with logging conventions at:
29/32 have timing (Completed in Xms)
22/32 have directory context (Entering directory)
25/32 use comma formatting (format_number)
Missing timing: fix.rs, parse.rs, review.rs (the original stub binaries)
Most of our active tools (count-, review-, fix-, analyze-) are following the conventions. We can circle back to standardize the rest later.
What would you like to work on next?

 Is attic excluded everywhere?

 What about lifting code from various things into the library?

 Where are we not reporting units that we should?

 Review the entire resticate codebase for string hacking and remove it.
