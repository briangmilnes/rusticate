i. ABSTRACT
----------------------------------------

This report analyzes stdlib usage across 1036 Rust projects (3636 unique crates)
compiled to MIR. We identify which modules, types, traits, and methods are most
used, and compute minimum sets needed to cover 70-99% of real-world usage.

Key findings:
  - 300 crates (8.2508%) have no stdlib usage (proc-macros, FFI, const-only)
  - Of 3336 crates WITH stdlib usage:
    - 1 types cover 96.1930%
    - 34 traits cover 55.0659%
    - 73 methods cover 86.1211%

================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

MIR (Mid-level Intermediate Representation) is Rust's fully-typed intermediate
representation generated during compilation. It captures all function calls, method
invocations, trait implementations, and type instantiations with their complete
qualified paths. From MIR we extract: direct method calls like Vec::new() and
Result::unwrap(), trait method calls like <Vec as IntoIterator>::into_iter, type
annotations like std::result::Result<T, E>, and constructor calls like
Option::<T>::Some(...). Each stdlib usage is attributed to the crate that generated
the MIR file.

MIR has limitations for usage analysis. Pattern matching (match result { Ok(x) => ... })
compiles to numeric discriminant checks, not named variant references - we can only
detect when Ok/Err/Some/None are constructed, not matched. The ? operator generates
FromResidual trait calls rather than explicit Result method calls. Type inference means
many uses are implicit. Macros expand before MIR, so macro-generated code appears as
regular calls. Consequently, our method and type coverage percentages represent a lower
bound - actual stdlib usage is higher than what MIR-based analysis can detect.

Greedy cover analysis uses different denominators for accuracy: module coverage uses all
crates with stdlib usage, type coverage uses only crates where we detected type usage,
and method coverage uses only crates where we detected method calls. This ensures 100%
coverage is achievable for each category.

2. STDLIB MODULES (by crate count)

   This helps us answer: Which stdlib modules are most widely used across real codebases?

   Lists 84 stdlib modules (std::, core::, alloc::) extracted from MIR files.
   Each module is counted once per crate that references it. Sorted by the number of
   unique crates using each module, then alphabetically. Shows Uses, Uses%%, No-use,
   No-use%% relative to the 3336 crates with detected stdlib usage.

3. CRATES WITHOUT STDLIB USAGE

   This helps us answer: How many crates don't use stdlib at all?

   Lists 300 crates where MIR analysis detected no stdlib calls. These are typically
   proc-macro crates (code runs at compile time), FFI stubs (extern "C" only), or
   const-only crates with no runtime code. Excluded from coverage percentage calculations
   since they cannot be covered by any stdlib item.

4. DATA TYPES (by crate count)

   This helps us answer: Which stdlib types are most frequently used?

   Lists 48 stdlib types (Result, Option, Vec, HashMap, etc.) found in MIR.
   Types are detected from: constructor calls (Some(...), Ok(...)), method receivers
   (vec.push()), type annotations in locals, and generic instantiations. Each type is
   counted once per crate. Shows Uses, Uses%%, No-use, No-use%% relative to crates with
   detected type usage.

5. STDLIB TRAITS (by crate count)

   This helps us answer: Which stdlib traits are most frequently used?

   Lists 85 stdlib traits (Iterator, Clone, Debug, IntoIterator, etc.) found in MIR.
   Traits are detected from trait method calls (<Type as Trait>::method patterns).
   Unlike types which are data structures, traits define behavioral contracts that must
   be specified separately for Verus verification. Each trait counted once per crate.

6. ALL STDLIB METHODS/FUNCTIONS (by crate count)

   This helps us answer: Which specific methods are called most often?

   Lists all 3582 stdlib methods and functions found in MIR, sorted by crate count.
   Extracted from direct calls (Vec::new()), method calls (result.unwrap()), and trait
   method calls (<T as Iterator>::next()). Generic parameters are stripped for grouping
   (Vec::<T>::push becomes Vec::push). Type names filtered out to show only methods.

7. GREEDY TOUCH COVER: MODULES

   'Touch' coverage: a crate is 'touched' if AT LEAST ONE module it uses is verified.
   Finds minimum modules so that N%% of crates use at least one verified module.
   Example: If we verify std::result, we 'touch' all crates that use Result.
   This does NOT mean those crates are fully supported - they may use other modules.

8. GREEDY FULL SUPPORT: MODULES

   'Full support' coverage: a crate is 'fully supported' when ALL modules it uses
   are verified. Finds minimum modules to fully support N%% of crates.
   Example: A crate using std::result + std::io needs BOTH verified for full support.
   This is the true verification cost - how much work to fully cover real codebases.

9. GREEDY TOUCH COVER: DATA TYPES

   'Touch' coverage for types: minimum types so N%% of crates use at least one.
   Useful for understanding which types have the widest reach.

10. GREEDY FULL SUPPORT: DATA TYPES

   'Full support' coverage for types: minimum types to fully support N%% of crates.
   A crate using Option + Vec + HashMap needs ALL THREE verified for full support.

11. GREEDY TOUCH COVER: TRAITS

   'Touch' coverage for traits: minimum traits so N%% of crates use at least one.
   Shows which trait specs have the widest reach across codebases.

12. GREEDY FULL SUPPORT: TRAITS

   'Full support' coverage for traits: minimum traits to fully support N%% of crates.
   A crate calling Iterator + Clone + Debug methods needs ALL verified for support.

13. GREEDY TOUCH COVER: METHODS/FUNCTIONS

   'Touch' coverage for methods: minimum methods so N%% of crates call at least one.
   Key insight: ~9 methods touch 90%% of crates (Result::unwrap alone touches 57%%).

14. GREEDY FULL SUPPORT: METHODS/FUNCTIONS

   'Full support' coverage for methods: minimum methods to fully support N%% of crates.
   This is the true method-level verification cost. A crate calling 50 methods needs
   all 50 verified for full support - much harder than just 'touching' crates.

15. GREEDY COVER: METHODS PER TYPE

   This helps us answer: For each type, which methods matter most?

   For each type (Vec, Option, Result, etc.), runs greedy cover on its methods.
   Shows minimum methods needed per type for 70-100%% coverage of that type's users.

16. TRAIT IMPLEMENTATIONS AND GREEDY METHOD COVER

   This helps us answer: Which trait methods are actually used in practice?

   Extracts trait implementations from MIR (e.g., <Vec as IntoIterator>::into_iter).
   For key traits (Iterator, Clone, Debug), runs greedy cover on trait methods.
   Iterator has 70+ methods but ~7 cover 99%% of real usage.

=== 14. GREEDY FULL SUPPORT: METHODS/FUNCTIONS ===
'Full support' coverage: A crate is fully supported when ALL methods it calls are verified.
Minimum methods to fully support (70/80/90/95/99/100)% of 2873 crates.
NOTE: This is much harder than touch coverage - most crates call many methods.

Methods per crate: min=1, median=9, max=218
