- [ ] Was every plan TODO completed or explicitly deferred/updated with rationale?
- [ ] Did actual work stay within the scope and constraints documented in the plan?
- [ ] Were all required source files created?
- [ ] Were all required test files created?
- [ ] Were all required benchmark files created?
- [ ] Are all copyright headers on line 1 with correct format?
- [ ] Are there any stub files that need implementation or proper "pending implementation" documentation?
- [ ] Were RustRulesChecklist and APASRulesChecklist executed at the points scheduled in the plan, and the results printed for the user?
- [ ] Is cargo build clean (no errors, no warnings)?
- [ ] Is cargo nextest run clean (no errors, no warnings)?
- [ ] Are there uses of Vec that are of known length and should be a sequence type? Fix them.
- [ ] Did you benchmark just each new src file created?
- [ ] Did the plan correctly implement parallelism (or call it) in each *Mt file?
- [ ] For Mt implementations with divide-and-conquer, did you use ParaPair! macro for true binary parallelism?
- [ ] Do all parallel operations have PARALLEL_THRESHOLD checks to avoid thread overhead on small inputs?
- [ ] Were all planned per-file checklists (e.g., PerSrc, PerTest, PerBenchmark) run after each file creation/update?
- [ ] Run the AlgorithmicAnalysis checklist. Was it met?
- [ ] Did you pause? Why and how can you prevent this in future?
- [ ] Make a plan to fix any defects found, one to-do for each file.
- [ ] Did the benchmarks compile with cargo bench --no-run? Fix any defects found.
- [ ] Ask the user if they want to run the full benchmark suite.
- [ ] Ask the user if they want you to commit changes to git.
- [ ] cargo +nightly fmt
